# Password Generator

This is a password generator made using Javascript. When a user clicks the "generate password" button, the application will ask for a number between 8 and 128. The application will then ask the user if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters in the password when it's generated. When the application has finished generating the password, it displays the new password on the screen for the user.
